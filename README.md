## 🔗 Google Sheets Integration (Contact Form)

The contact form is linked to a Google Sheet using Google Apps Script. When a user submits the form:
1. Data is sent via `fetch()` from the frontend.
2. Google Apps Script captures the data.
3. Data is appended to a Google Sheet in real-time.

This avoids the need for any backend server or database for basic form handling.
